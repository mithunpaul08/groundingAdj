Welcome to Grounding For Adjectives. Please pick one of the following:
To train and save using adj based split press :1
To train on all the data (not adj based split) press :5
To train with nfoldCV on entire data (no adj based split)  press:2
To train with nfoldCV on  adj based split)  press:6
To test using a saved model on alldata_test_partition which was trained on entire data 80-10-10 press:3
To test using a saved model on adj_based_data_test_partition which was trained on adj_based_split press:4
To exit Press:0
what is your choice:str(len(features)):
